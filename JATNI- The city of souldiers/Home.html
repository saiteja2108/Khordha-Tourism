In the year 2000, the district’s name was changed from Khurda to Khordha. The district headquarters is located in Khordha Town, formerly known as Jajarsingh or Kurada, (kurada means foul mouthed).it is also told that the word is derived from two Odia words- “Khura” and “Dhara”, meaning razor and edge, probably because the soldiers of Khurda were as sharp and dreadful as the edge of a razor.
